																&lt;br /&gt;
																FE recently hosted a successful evening at leading private business club, the Mercantile Athletic Club Jakarta on Thursday 19th February 2009. The bi-monthly event, which was held for exclusive members of the club, was attended by over 110 members. Presidential Director Mr. KC Poon, attended the event together with Presidential Director Stanley Liew and Presidential Director Willy Toh. The event was arranged by members of the club, Mr. &amp;amp; Mrs. Le Riche.&lt;br /&gt;
																&lt;br /&gt;
																The evening event started promptly at 7pm at the World Tade Centre, with a warm welcome by the new General Manager of the club, followed by a short speech and demonstration from Mr. KC Poon. The crowd was amazed at how the Quantum Science products worked and the demonstrations became the focus of the evening with lots of members offering themselves as volunteers to try out the FusionExcel products. The event was topped with a guest appearance by Ade Rai, Indonesia&amp;#39;s Champion Body Builder and FE Spokesman who got up on stage and gave his own testimonial to endorse the product.&lt;br /&gt;
																&lt;br /&gt;
																A mouth watering buffet was served for everyone with free flowing drinks throughout the evening. Entertainment included a live band and performances from the members themselves who put together a couple of dance routines for the evening. Everyone enjoyed the evening, with 8 lucky members of the Mercantile Athletic Club winning FusionExcel Products as lucky draw prizes. All in all, the event was a big success and proved once again that FusionExcel is expanding by leaps and bounds!&lt;br /&gt;
