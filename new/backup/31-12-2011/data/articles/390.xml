																FE Quantum Pendant created a lot of interest and excitement with mobile phone users at its booth. Young and old participated in the demos done by FE members. Many were initially shocked to discover that mobile phones can deplete one&amp;#39;s energy levels, quite significantly but after using the FE Pendant along with their phones they were totally amazed at the surge of energy, the flexibility as well as the strength they got and the difference it made.&lt;br /&gt;
																&lt;br /&gt;
																Dr Raj and Jo Pillai, who organized this FE event, were at hand to oversee and give assistance to their new members in doing the demos and explaining the benefits of the products. Dr Siva Poobalasingam gave an enlightening talk on EMF radiation and how FE Scalar energy products can offer protection for mobile phone users. Presidential Directors Rachael Thomas, Albert Pang and Patricia Thava were there to give their support.&lt;br /&gt;
																&lt;br /&gt;
																Awareness was created among mobile phone users on the dangers of over using mobile phones. Many young participants were not aware of EMF radiation emitted from their phones and the negative impact it had on their health. The message imparted was that mobile phones are necessary devices, that are here to stay but it is possible to protect oneself from the harmful radiation. This expo was a wonderful opportunity to educate and share the extraordinary FE products.&lt;br /&gt;
																&lt;br /&gt;
																There were also many inquiries about the FE business opportunity from foreign delegates and we are currently in discussion with some of them.&lt;br /&gt;
																&lt;br /&gt;
																We are very confident that with this exposure there will be many who will soon be looking for FE products. Many thanks to FusionExcel for all the support and encouragement in making this event a great success.&lt;br /&gt;
