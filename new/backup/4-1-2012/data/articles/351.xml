The Golf Fair was much larger than Penang and Johor and the special offers from all the exhibitors put smiles on all the buyers faces.  The FE members that were there all benefited and at one stage we were not sure if it was a Pendant demo day or a long drive event with demos being performed at all corners of the event.
