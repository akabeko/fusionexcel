																No Amazing Race season is without its resident eye candy but with leggy beauties Pailin and Natalie, their team has one credential none of the previous good looking teams in race history ever had being in a Miss Universe pageant and winning one!&lt;br /&gt;
																&lt;br /&gt;
																25 year old Pailin Rungratanasunthorn was the first runner up in 2006 Miss Thailand Universe and represented her country as Miss Thailand Earth 2006 as well.&lt;br /&gt;
																&lt;br /&gt;
																It is no wonder that beauty pageants are part of their blood, having met in the 2006 Miss Thailand Universe pageant and becoming fast friends after that. Pailin was also one of Natalie&amp;#39;s bridesmaids when she married Thailand&amp;#39;s highest ranked tennis player, Paradorn Srichaphan, in November 2007.&lt;br /&gt;
																&lt;br /&gt;
																But beauty is not the only thing that links the Thailand team together. Both have acute business sense as they are running their own business. Pailin&amp;#39;s company makes toys, T-shirts and gifts for sale online, while Natalie&amp;#39;s company sells beauty products across Thailand.&lt;br /&gt;
																&lt;br /&gt;
																Describing herself, Pailin notes of her decision to participate in The Amazing Race, &amp;quot;I am really competitive and I want to do something where I can put my energy in it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
																&lt;br /&gt;
																Agreeing, Natalie adds, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re both very competitive and cannot stand to lose. We love to travel, love to do adrenaline like things, love to experience new cultures and learn.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
																&lt;br /&gt;
																And with both their credentials, traveling has become second nature to them. Pailin has traveled to Japan, China, South Africa, and Egypt while Natalie, other than gracing beauty pageants around the world, has attended the G8 Summit in New York, and as a HIV/AIDS awareness advocate, has traveled extensively to India and Africa.&lt;br /&gt;
																&lt;br /&gt;
																Having spent their formative years in the beauty circuit, the damsels know a bit about what it takes to stay ahead. And having seen the show on television, the duo is also gunning to experience the thrills and tumbles that only the race can deliver. Exclaims Natalie, &amp;quot;We love to try new things. Give us bungee jumping, parachuting, paragliding and parasailing any day!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
																&lt;br /&gt;
																She adds, &amp;quot;We are competitive, we&amp;#39;re in shape and we&amp;#39;re going to kick ass.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
																&lt;br /&gt;
																The girls have started preparing for the trek around the world based on what the previous Amazing Race Asia seasons were like. Surprisingly, their strategy for winning is to be the underdog and &amp;quot;fly under the radar&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s hope that no one will take us too seriously so we won&amp;#39;t be recognized as a threat until it&amp;#39;s too late!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
