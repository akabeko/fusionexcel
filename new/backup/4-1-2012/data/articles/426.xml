																	FE celebrated New Year 2009 with a great party attended by a capacity crowd of 500 enthusiastic FE Leaders and invited guests at FE&amp;#39;S HQ on Wednesday 07th January 2009! There was great food (barbeque lambs and more!), entertainment and motivational sharing by FE Founder Director KS Lee together with FE Presidential Directors KC Phoon, Jeffrey Chong and Australian trainer Bruce Flanagan.&lt;br /&gt;
																	&lt;br /&gt;
																	2008 had been a FANTASTIC year for FE! Remember the PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando USA in January 17th-19th January 2008. That was when we really started our overseas expansion. In ONE year FE has built a BRAND across 130 countries and established 30 Country Licensees! That is PHENOMINAL! Thank You All!&lt;br /&gt;
																	&lt;br /&gt;
																	In 2009, we will not be resting on our laurels. Far from it! In fact we will INTENSIFY our efforts and go DEEP in each country, especially in Indonesia, Vietnam, Australia, Middle East, etc, etc. The world is now facing an ECONOMIC CRISIS. There is NEVER a better time for MLM to grow and prosper. FE is poised and ready to go all out in the next 6 months to take advantage of this ONCE IN A LIFETIME and build greater market share. With our GREAT PRODUCTS and INCOME PLAN, our PROVEN TRACK RECORD, our ENORMOUS RESOURCES &amp;amp; INFRASTRUCTURE and our PROVEN LEADERS we will build the World&amp;#39;s Greatest MLM Company!&lt;br /&gt;
																	&lt;br /&gt;
																	For 2009, to be VERY successful (not just successful), we must all FOCUS &amp;amp; COMMIT and act with VELOCITY and SINCERITY! We must also be INNOVATIVE and AGGRESSIVE to beat off competition. It has been a great and satisfying ride so far, a lot of us had made money (for some, a lot of money!), a lot of people across the world had benefited from using our QP, a lot of sports had benefited from our sponsorships, a lot of less fortunate members of society had benefited from our donations/charities and with everyone&amp;#39;s SUPPORT and COMMITTMENT in 2009, we will continue to ride proudly with our heads held high, ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP!&lt;br /&gt;
																	&lt;br /&gt;
																	SEE YOU ALL AT THE TOP! AHOO!! AHOO!! AHOO!! TO VICTORY!!&lt;br /&gt;
