												&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCOTT SMITH LONG DRIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
												&lt;br /&gt;
												Long Drive Accomplishments:&lt;br /&gt;
												- 2002 Pinnacle Distance Challenge Beating John Daly by 36 yards for $100,000.&lt;br /&gt;
												- 2003, 2004, 2005 &amp;amp; 2006 World Finalist.&lt;br /&gt;
												- Finished 5th 2005 World Long Drive Championship.&lt;br /&gt;
												- Finished 14th 2004 World Long Drive Championship.&lt;br /&gt;
												- 2005 District Champion.&lt;br /&gt;
												- Current World Record Holder of 539 yards in LDA Competition (Albuquerque, NM 2005).&lt;br /&gt;
												- Sponsored and Trained by Parrillo Performance Athlete Training.&lt;br /&gt;
												&lt;br /&gt;
												Training five days a week, and hitting a thousand balls a week can be hard on the body. After wearing the Quantum Pendant for just a few days, I noticed less pain and fatigue. I have also noticed my swing speed jumped up a few mph on a consistent basis. I have had various pains in my shoulders and elbows since competing on the long drive tour. Since wearing the Quantum Pendant, I have very little problems with any pain. I would recommend the Quantum Pendant for anyone from all walks of life.&lt;br /&gt;

</content><meta><description>FE's Founder CEO Paul Ting appeared on Thailand's Nation Channel TTV1's program "Khondee Me Sa Ra ", " Good Stories From Good People " with TV host Don Chan (who is also FE's Thai Country Licensee) to talk about FE's social entrepreneurship program "Hope For Children". Appearing on the program was Thai Movie Superstar Dr Sombat Methanee, with 700 movies to his credit, Jerome Vinarao, President of the Center For Arts Foundation, Philippines and 9 year year old Filipino singing sensation Clark Gamul who is a product of the Center For Arts Foundation. Clark performed 3 songs for the TV program. The Center For Arts Foundation, with many Filipino celebrities and artistes who contribute their time and effort to help train and groom talented children from poor families, has 11 centres throughout the Philippines and has trained over 75,000 Filipinos in the performing arts over it's 10 years history.

 

FE's "Hope For Children" Charity program will be collaborating with the Philippines Center For Arts Foundation and Thai Superstar Dr Sombat Methanee to set up a similar Foundation in Thailand to help train and groom Thai children from poor families in the performing arts. At the same time there will be exchanges of celebrities, artistes and talented children between Thailand and Philippines which will foster better relationships and goodwill between the two countries. 

 

FE hopes that with the financial support from FE's "Hope For Children" Charity Program similar Foundations can be set up in Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos in the immediate future and later throughout the world. FE believes that to change the world and to make it a better place we need to start with the children. Children are our future leaders and FE is proud that we are able to lend them a supporting hand !

 

The "Khondee Me Sa Ra" TV program similar in style to CNN's Larry King program, will be aired over 3 days on Sunday 6th September, Saturday 12th September and Sunday 13th September at 2.30 pm Thailand time.

 

Repeats will be aired on Thursday 10th September, Wednesday 16th September and Thursday 17th September at 2.30 pm Thailand time.</description><keyword></keyword><robots>all</robots><author>klhunter</author></meta><alt_title></alt_title></en><bm><title>Laos Leaders Visit Thai Country Licensee's Office!</title><content></content><meta><description>FE's Founder CEO Paul Ting appeared on Thailand's Nation Channel TTV1's program "Khondee Me Sa Ra ", " Good Stories From Good People " with TV host Don Chan (who is also FE's Thai Country Licensee) to talk about FE's social entrepreneurship program "Hope For Children".
