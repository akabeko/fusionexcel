</content><meta><description>The second leg of the FE Long Drive Challenge was held at the Palm Resort and Country Club, Johore Bahru, on 22nd October 2008.

Just like Penang, it was another very exciting showdown between 100 over competitors from all over the world, including from South America, Singapore, Australia and South Africa.

We also had our first international qualifier from South Africa, the 21 year old Divan Piesamie who managed to top the leader board at the end of the day and qualify for the Grand Finals on the 5th of November.

The leader board changed consistently throughout the day with many competitors having to re enter just to stay on the board.

Again there were over 1000 people walking around the golf fair taking advantage of the many great discounts and benefits from the merchants.

The FE members who were there, all managed to scoop up many new members and sales. We are all looking forward to the KL legs as we expect the competitors and spectators to increase three fold.

If you have not been to one of the qualifying events yet you are missing out on an incredibly exciting show! But don't worry, there are still 3 more days for all to experience FE's Golf Long Drive Challenge.
