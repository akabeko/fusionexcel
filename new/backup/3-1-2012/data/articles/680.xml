													FE Founder CEO Paul Ting, together with Presidential Director KC Phoon, attended Thai Presidential Director Jankij&amp;#39;s BEP (OPP) at Town In Town Hotel, Bangkok, recently on Wednesday 05th August 2009. The BEP, which is held on the first Wednesday of every month, was attended by a full capacity crowd of around 1,000 enthusiastic Leaders, Members and Invited Guests. There were talks, sharing and presentations by FE&amp;#39;s successful Thai PDs and demonstrations with the QP. FE&amp;#39;s Achievers Awards were presented by Paul Ting to newly qualified Directors, Executive Directors and Presidential Directors. PD Jankij&amp;#39;s group is growing from strength to strength, with 42 PDs under him now. What an achievement!&lt;/p&gt;
												&lt;p&gt;
													Paul Ting, in his speech, talked about FE&amp;#39;s soon to be launched &amp;quot;Hope For Children&amp;quot; Charity and how it will help propel FE to the next level and at the same time help thousands of poor and needy children of this world. Paul also talked on the simple key to success, which is simply to follow another successful person! ( in the case of FE, a successful PD ) However, how successful you will be depends on how desperate or how hungry you are to succeed. Paul cited the case of Thai PD Juk, a lady who was working at odd jobs day and night just to buy food for her children. Juk was desperate. She was fortunate to be introduced to FE and worked very hard to build her business. Today Juk has a new house, a new car and and a new life as a Presidential Director traveling all over Thailand (in her new car) helping many others like her to succeed with FE. If Juk can make it, so can you!&lt;/p&gt;
