Myanmar Visit 11th - 18th March 2009.



A delegation of 4 started the journey to Myanmar after the Country Licensee was appointed in January 2009. The group comprising Chew Cheng Kiat, Visaka Lee, Janet Lim &amp; Stanley Liew arrived at the Capital City,Yangon, on 11th March 2009. Presidential Director Willy Toh joined the group on 15th March in Yangon.



Yangon has a population of about 6 million and the country is developing and progressing fast economically. The population of Myanmar is about 40 million.



The team was joined by 3 local colleagues, U Chan Kyaw Kyaw, U Chua Ban Hoo &amp;. U Kyaw Soe Lin from the Country Licensee’s office. We traveled by road to Mandalay, another city, 600 km north of Yangon. The arduous journey to Mandalay took 12 hours including stopover for dinner at the Administrative Centre of Myanmar at Nay Pyi Daw.



The next day, 12th March 2009, Visaka stole the show with 2 presentations for 2 groups of about 40 pax each followed by our usual Quantum Pendant demonstrations. The presentation was in English, thanks to U Chan Kyaw Kyaw for his simultaneous translation to Burmese language. The response was overwhelming, with many Quantum Pendants, Flasks, Bracelets &amp; Watches sold.



In total we had 9 presentations &amp; demonstrations attended by over 254 people. The highlight was the presentation &amp; demonstration to the Pun Hlaing International Hospital at Yangon, attended by 62 Doctors, Nurses, Lab. Technicians and Hospital Staff.



On the whole it was a success and fruitful trip, and we had exposed our Quantum Science Products to many people during the 8-day visit.</description><keyword>FE Expands into Myanmar!</keyword><robots>all</robots><author>klhunter</author></meta><alt_title></alt_title></bm><chi><title>FE Expands into Myanmar!</title><content></content><meta><description>REPORT SUBMITTED BY FE LEADER, VISAKA LEE.
