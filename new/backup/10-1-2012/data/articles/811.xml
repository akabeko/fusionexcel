					As part of FE&amp;#39;s continued commitment to help the needy and underpriveleged, FE is donating 250,000 pesos (RM 20,000) to Foundation for the Soup Kitchen, Food Bank &amp;amp; Training Center Inc and Lighthouse Center for Children Foundation Inc, Quezon City, Philippines.&lt;br /&gt;
					&lt;br /&gt;
					These two foundations provide feeding and value formation programs, education and training programs in the Payatas district, the most depressed community in Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines, known as &amp;quot;Smokey Mountain&amp;quot;, which is home to 1000 families whos main source of livelihood is scavenging from the refuse and garbage of Metro Manila. The foundation feeds hundreds of children in Payatas per day. The cost of the feeding program is about US$0.20 per child per day, which is made possible through the support and cooperation of supermarkets and food stores as well as generous persons, firms and corporations.&lt;br /&gt;
					&lt;br /&gt;
					The donation was received on behalf of the foundations by its President and Executive Trustee Judge Lorenzo B. Veneracion. Judge Lorenzo is also the Charter President Rotary Club of Quezon City North.&lt;/p&gt;
