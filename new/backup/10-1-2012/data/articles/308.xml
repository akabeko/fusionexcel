																&amp;lsquo;WOW&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;UNBELIEVABLE&amp;rsquo; were the most common expressions heard at FE&amp;rsquo;s first public event in Perth, Australia - the 20th Conscious Living EXPO last week (4th- 7th September). Over 160 Organisations took part in the event, mostly from the Health, Wellness and Alternative Treatment Modalities.&lt;br /&gt;
																&lt;br /&gt;
																Patricia Hamilton, the &lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;EXPO&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/span&gt; Founder Director acknowledged FE as having the &amp;lsquo;busiest booth&amp;rsquo; at the event. She also described FE&amp;rsquo;s booth as having &amp;lsquo;created&amp;rsquo; a lot of ENERGY to the entire show. Hundreds of visitors took part in the demos and were amazingly surprised and excited with the Quantum Pendant demo results.&lt;br /&gt;
																&lt;br /&gt;
																Sales were brisk and many expressed keen interest to acquire the products.&amp;nbsp; By the end of the show there were many visitors and other booth holders proudly wearing the QP.&amp;nbsp; Also, there were already testimonials being shared and lots of awareness created. Numerous enquiries were received for distributorship.&lt;br /&gt;
																&lt;br /&gt;
																Dr Siva&amp;rsquo;s talks were also well received and gave a scientific dimension to the understanding of Scalar Energy.&lt;br /&gt;
																&lt;br /&gt;
																About 20 Full Time and Part Time Distributors took part in the event headed by&amp;nbsp; Australian Country Licensee T.Vasudavan.&amp;nbsp; PDs Rachel Thomas,&amp;nbsp; Albert Phang and Distributor Thava were also present to support the team.&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;lsquo;WOW&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;UNBELIEVABLE&amp;rsquo; were the most common expressions heard at FE&amp;rsquo;s first public event in Perth, Australia - the 20th Conscious Living EXPO last week (4th- 7th September). Over 160 Organisations took part in the event, mostly from the Health, Wellness and Alternative Treatment Modalities.

Patricia Hamilton, the EXPO&amp;rsquo;s Founder Director acknowledged FE as having the &amp;lsquo;busiest booth&amp;rsquo; at the event. She also described FE&amp;rsquo;s booth as having &amp;lsquo;created&amp;rsquo; a lot of ENERGY to the entire show. Hundreds of visitors took part in the demos and were amazingly surprised and excited with the Quantum Pendant demo results.

Sales were brisk and many expressed keen interest to acquire the products.  By the end of the show there were many visitors and other booth holders proudly wearing the QP.  Also, there were already testimonials being shared and lots of awareness created. Numerous enquiries were received for distributorship.

Dr Siva&amp;rsquo;s talks were also well received and gave a scientific dimension to the understanding of Scalar Energy.

About 20 Full Time and Part Time Distributors took part in the event headed by  Australian Country Licensee T.Vasudavan.  PDs Rachel Thomas,  Albert Phang and Distributor Thava were also present to support the team.

To put it simply, FE Australia&amp;rsquo;s first public event was a GREAT SUCCESS!
