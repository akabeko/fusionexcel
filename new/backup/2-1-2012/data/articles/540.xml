				Dr Amir Farid, FE&amp;#39;s Medical Consultant and Star Newspaper Columnist, presented a talk on FE&amp;#39;s Scalar Energized RVT to an enthusiastic audience at FE&amp;#39;s Headquarter on 16th April 2009.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;br /&gt;
				It is a well known fact that the French are able to consume large amounts of fat in their diet but not suffer from heart disease partly due to the red wine they consume. Red wine contains RVT. The compound RVT can be found in some plant types. Interestingly, RVT does not exist naturally in these plants but is created by these plants under specific circumstances. Usually these plants produce RVT as a reaction against a stressful situation. In these plants RVT acts like a natural antibiotic, shielding the plants against pathogens. FE&amp;#39;s RVT is produced from Polygonum Cuspidatum or Japanese knotweed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Properties of RVT:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;br /&gt;
				- Reverse the advances of disease associated with old age such as arthritis, high blood pressure, high&lt;br /&gt;
				&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;cholesterol and diabetes.&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;br /&gt;
				- Ability to avert cardiovascular disease.&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;br /&gt;
				- Ability to avert diseases linked with high blood sugar, such as metabolic syndrome or diabetes by inducing&lt;br /&gt;
				&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;weight loss.&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;br /&gt;
				- Helps in the management of Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease and other forms of dementia by countering the effects of&lt;br /&gt;
				&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;oxidative damage. Offer protection against cerebral ischemic injury by combating free radical activity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;br /&gt;
				- Increases lean body mass including bones, vital organs, skin and tissues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;br /&gt;
				- Practically non-existant toxic effects in healthy cells high efficacy against multiple sites.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;br /&gt;
				- Ability to enhance health by fuelling energy production in the mitochondria anti-oxidant ability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;br /&gt;
				- Reduces mental deterioration : No grumpy men and old women.&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion: Intake of RVT will make you feel and look 10 to 20 years younger!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Mechanism by which RVT enhances longevity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;br /&gt;
				- Influencing patterns of gene expression&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;br /&gt;
				- Anti-oxidant ability&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;br /&gt;
				- Enhancing cellular energy production&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;

Conclusion: Intake of RVT will make you feel and look 10 to 20 years younger!



Mechanism by which RVT enhances longevity



- Influencing patterns of gene expression



- Anti-oxidant ability



- Enhancing cellular energy production
