													FE is proud to sponsor Surech Kuppusamy and the K-2 Challenge for Charity expedition and looks forward to FE&amp;#39;s flag plated on the summit of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Mount K-2&lt;/strong&gt;, the world&amp;#39;s second highest and most challenging mountain to climb.&lt;br /&gt;
													&lt;br /&gt;
													Mount K2 (28,240 feet) is the 2nd highest mountain on Earth and has been referred to as the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Gold Medal in Mountaineering&lt;/strong&gt;It is dramatically harder than Mount Everest, the highest mountain on Earth, and is considered the &amp;quot;Hardest Mountain on Earth&amp;quot;. Only 241 people have made it to the summit of K2 versus over 3000 that have summated Everest. Of these 241 individuals 60 have perished on their decent from the summit, making it the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;most dangerous mountain on the planet&lt;/strong&gt;. K2 is dramatically steeper than Everest and has much more unpredictable and severe weather patterns.&lt;br /&gt;
													&lt;br /&gt;
													Mount K-2 Challenge for Charity expedition will commence on May 31, 2008. The team will converge in Pakistan where they will spend several days packing and organizing of 8000kgs of equipment which will be transported 18 kilometers up the Baltoro Glacier on the backs of the expedition team and the support crew. Broad Peak, the 13th highest peak in the world (8000meters / 25,000 feet), will serve as an initial acclimatization climb. The climb of Broad Peak is expected to take around 20days. The expedition will then continue up the Baltoro Glacier over several days to the Base Camp of K2. The following month will be spent establishing Camps 1-4 and transporting tents, gear, food, and oxygen to the higher camps. During this time the team will climb the equivalent vertical distance of having climbed the mountain from base to summit 3-4 times. There is generally only an 8-day window each year (last week of July and first week of August) during which the weather is suitable for a summit bid. Once in place at Camp 4 (26,000 feet), the team will await the opening of the weather and make their summit bid.&lt;br /&gt;
													&lt;br /&gt;
													Collectively the team members have the experience on major peaks, which includes Mount Everest, Cho Oyu, Manaslu, Shishapangma, Chogolisa, Ecuador, Masherbrum Nanga Parbat, Ama Dablam, and Broad Peak between them.&lt;br /&gt;
													&lt;br /&gt;

Mount Cho Oyu is located on the border of Tibet and Nepal. The 2007 Expedition took place in the month of September and October of 2007. This peak poses a very high challenge of endurance due to its altitude. The climbers were also hit by the worst storm in the Himalayas since the last eleven years, during the climb. Because of the hurricane wind, the team tents and equipments were destroyed. The climbers had to continue with the remaining equipments and food supply. This peak was attempted without supplementary oxygen and the expedition was concluded mid-October of 2007.
