				Our final qualifying brought out all the big guns. As the popularity grew and the word spread after our successful first 3 qualifying in Penang, Johor Bahru and KGSAAS, we had people lining up before the event started.&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;br /&gt;
				The Amateurs finally got to strut their stuff against some of Malaysia&amp;rsquo;s top professionals including Rizam Ali, Hanafiah Jamil, Mohd Paizal Bee, Mohd Zurie, Mohd Khairul, Nazri B Najid, Zamri Sariff, Mohd Rusli Johari. But it were the Amateurs who were not intimidated by the Pros and soon they dominated the leader board.&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;br /&gt;
				For the first time we had so many people lining up we had to have 2 people on the tee at once. Even with a 2 hours rain delay no one left. So with record entrance and over 1000 people coming to the event the FusionExcel Long Drive Challenge was really ready for its Finals on the 05th November 2008.&lt;/td&gt;
