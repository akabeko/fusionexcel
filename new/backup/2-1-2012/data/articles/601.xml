				Alvin Patrimonio (FE Spokesman), Philippine Basketball Association&amp;rsquo;s only other 4 times Most Valuable Player and one of the League&amp;rsquo;s 25 Greatest Players, once dreamed and fulfilled that dream of playing for the Philippine flag in the Southeast Asian Games and the Asian Games. It&amp;rsquo;s not surprising to hear him saying the same thing for his daughters, Anna Christine and Anna Clarice, who are both into sports, playing competitive tennis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;br /&gt;
				&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s my ultimate dream for them,&amp;rdquo; said the proud father of the two siblings who underwent rigorous training sessions in Spain. &amp;ldquo;I am very happy to see them playing for the national team, competing for the country. I&amp;rsquo;m really proud of what they&amp;rsquo;re achieving right now.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;br /&gt;
				His daughters, along with wife, Cindi Patrimonio, were based in Spain for several years as the young Anna Christine and Anna Clarice pursued their careers in tennis. For Alvin Patrimonio, being away from his family is one of the biggest trials he encountered. But their sacrifices reaped good dividends as the two tennis stars have improved by leaps and bounds as proven by their worthy performances.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
				&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;

				&amp;ldquo;Tennis is a very tough sport because it requires both upper body strength and leg power,&amp;rdquo; said Patrimonio. &amp;ldquo;It is also a game for tough minded individuals. I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen them play in almost three years and I am so amazed at how much they have improved! And without a shadow of doubt, I strongly believe lots of credit should go to FusionExcel&amp;#39;s products for my daughters&amp;#39; tremendous progress and impressive performances. Their game literally took another level since I introduced the products to them&amp;quot;.&lt;/td&gt;
