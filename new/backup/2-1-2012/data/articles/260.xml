9 parachutists then jumped from the helicopter at a height of 6000 feet bearing FE Quantum Pendant flag, 2 Malaysian flags, 2 Thai flags, 2 FE Logo flags and 2 Great Honour International Logo flags, landing safely in the Multi Purpose Activity area of Hua Mak.

9 Cavalries on horsebacks received the flags from the parachutists and led by a military marching band with parade of VIPs and dancers, carried the flags 100 metres to the centre stage where they were raised , together with a 7 foot replica of FE's Quantum Pendant.

There was a ribbon cutting ceremony by the VIP's and release of balloons followed by congratulatory speeches by the VIPs.

Don Chan also launched his first book titled &amp;quot; From Thoughts to Opportunities&amp;quot; at the event.

Guests were entertained by musical performances, famous singers and dancers on the stage. VIPs attending include General Dato Kitti Rattanachaya, Police General and Senator Sunthorn Saikwan, Police Major General Angkul Arthornphathai, Major General Khattiya Sawaddipot  (Sae-Dang), Associate Professor Phichai Towiwit, Prof Dr Kriengsak Chareonwongsak PHD (Former MP and Author of 200 books) , Thewan Sapsaenyakorn (Father of Thai Jazz), Sombat Methanee (well known Actor), Rit Louescha (well known Actor), Surabadin Sombatchareon (well known Actor and Singer), Veera Bamroongsri (well known Singer), Vinai Phanturak (well known Singer), Surachai Sombatjaroen (well known Singer), Looktan Daensawan (famous folk Singer).

To cap off the historical day ,an amazing thing happened towards the closing of the event. There was a light shower of rain and TWO rainbows and colourful clouds appeared in the sky above the event! It was a beautiful sight to behold and a fitting end to a SUCCESSFUL day. No amount of human planning can make two rainbows appear at the closing of an event on cue!  It is indeed a GREAT BLESSING from the Heavens above and augers well for the SUCCESS of FE in Thailand!
