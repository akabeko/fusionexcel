																FE recently sponsored Masters Football in Macau and Malaysia, where 36 UK football legends from Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and EPL All Stars pitched their skills against one another to claim the Malaysian Masters Football Cup 2008. FE was represented by Arsenal with the players proudly wearing FE&amp;#39;s colours, blue with FE&amp;#39;s logo in yellow prominently on the front. The matches were telecast live on SkySports to millions in Europe and repeated the following day on Astro Sports. It was a GREAT branding opportunity for FE and for introducing FE&amp;#39;s Quantum Pendant to football crazy Europe. All the participating UK football legends were presented with the QP and were shown the demos. They were all very impressed and several amongst them wanted to do FE&amp;#39;s network marketing business back in UK! FE&amp;#39;s QP is really going places!&lt;br /&gt;
