FE recently exhibited at the annual Olympia Lake Fair 2009, Washington, USA. Led by Presidential Director Kenny Wong &amp;amp; FE Leader Dr. Yuhan Hou (who is also a stockiest in Washington, USA), the FE booth &amp;amp; the amazing FE QP demos attracted much attention from the curious crowd during the 5 days fair.



During the exhibition, Mr. Archiebeque, the Founder &amp;amp; Grand Master of Gun Fu Martial Art visited the FE booth. Mr. Archiebeque was highly impressed by the FE products. He told us that he could feel the ¡°Chi¡± energy in the FE Quantum Pendant. 



We were later invited to visit Mr. Archiebeque's dojo after the exhibition. We performed demonstrations to a few of his instructors at his dojo. He is very pleased with FE Products &amp;amp; has invited Dr. Yuhan to a few of the local martial art events.



Dr. Yuhan Hou also invited a dozen of his friends to his home for a BBQ. PD Kenny Wong performed amazing QP demonstrations on them. Tom, who had a stroke 3 years ago, had no feeling on his right arm and right leg. After wearing a few FE QP &amp;amp; being &amp;quot;treated&amp;quot; with the scalar energized water for about 1? hours, Tom was able to lift up his right leg and the senses returned to his arm again!!



Mr. Clyde Drury also shared his testimonial after using the FE Products. He had 25 knee surgeries and suffered from chronic knee pain. Every day he was on multiple prescriptions of painkillers. After using FE QP &amp;amp; Quantum Flask, he is now without pain and totally off all medication!!



The exhibition was a successful event. A few visitors to the booth have already expressed keen interest to signup as stockiest! Ahoo! Ahoo!!
