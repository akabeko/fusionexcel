All the particpants were greatly motivated at the end of the training program. They also had much fun during the tele-match games.



&amp;quot;Before coming to MAP, inorder to progress further I knew I need to change myself including my direction.&amp;nbsp;However I just don't know how to get there. I'm happy I came because MAP has shown me clearly which direction to take &amp;amp; also my dream of becoming a millionaire is now truly achievable!&amp;quot;
