	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;REPORT BY FE LEADER DIRECTOR KC CHEW.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Presidential Director Paul Ting &amp;amp; Doris Lee recently organized a talk led by Master Bahauddin Yap and assisted by Master Rebecca Then &amp;amp; World Kick Boxing Champion Master Bathi Alimuthu for their group LEAD Team of about 100 participants in Johor Bahru recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The talk kicked off with Master Yap sharing the 10 psychological reasons why prospects FEAR buying, the powerful words &amp;amp; body languages to use and also taboos to avoid when meeting with a prospect. Master Yap also amply demonstrated the power of our mind, by controlling a volunteer to either resist or fail in his strength test by merely using subconscious suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Master Rebecca Then helmed the second part of the talk by exercising our less dominant mind followed by a role playing session where participants were taught to mind map their prospects and classifying them as Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic, Olfactory or Gustatory prospect. This will then determine the type of approach we should use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the third session, we were challenged mentally &amp;amp; physically to breakthrough our mindset to greater heights by Master Bathi. Participants were required to break planks symbolizing obstacles to their success. Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The event was well received by more than 100 attendants; audience participation in the energy demonstration was overwhelming. It was one of the best FE talks ever held in JB.&amp;rdquo; - Stephen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen &amp;amp; also performed countless FE demonstrations myself, yet what Master Yap accomplished on stage totally blew my mind! Without a doubt, he&amp;rsquo;s a true Master in energy sciences&amp;rdquo; - KC Chew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The 3 masters have truly proven that the Mind is our Most Powerful Weapon. Focus on your goal, remove all obstacles and JUST DO IT!&amp;rdquo; - Angelica Wong.&lt;/p&gt;
