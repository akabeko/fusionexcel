	&lt;strong&gt;REPORT BY FE PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTOR AMY TEH.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;FE BUSINESS TRIP TO HYDERABAD AND CHENNAI, INDIA 24th - 31ST MARCH 2009.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Namaste! India, the most populous democracy in the world, has an estimated population of 1.17 billion, representing 17% of the world&amp;#39;s population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	On the 24th of March 2009, 4 FE Leaders including Presidential Director Amy Teh, Master Ricky Wong, Michell Koo and Ugene Woon flew to India to promote FusionExcel&amp;#39;s excellent range of scalar energy products to the people of India.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	With the warm reception that greeted us upon our arrival in India, we wasted no time in making arrangements to meet the key people there. We were joined by very close friends, Mr Pattabhi and Mr Bharat who arranged the daily meetings. Everyday large group of prospects came over to find out more about our products. Many of them were suitably impressed with the demos and immediately bought at least one set for themselves and their families.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	On our trip to Hyderabad, we had the rare opportunity to meet the Indian National Track and Field Coach N Ramesh and we watch Indian Olympic athletes doing their training. Being sportsmen, injuries are part and parcel of their daily life. So it was a good opportunity to showcase to them the effectiveness of FE&amp;#39;s Quantum Science products. The athletes who tried out our Quantum Pendants reported relieve to their back injuries almost instantaneously while another athlete, who had a sprained ankle informed us that she could stretch and bend her legs a short while later! This led to the coach and another national veteran runner trying the QP for themselves and they were very much pleased with the results! They even enquired when we will be returning to India again!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	We believe that India has a very huge potential to be transformed into another major market and our initial trip focused on laying the ground work for future development. We envisioned that with the establishment of FusionExcel in India, it would be the best springboard for reaching out to the many people there who really need our products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

FE BUSINESS TRIP TO HYDERABAD AND CHENNAI, INDIA 24th - 31ST MARCH 2009.



Namaste! India, the most populous democracy in the world, have an estimated population of 1.17 billion, representing 17% of the world's population.



On the 24th of March 2009, 4 FE Leaders including Presidential Director Amy Teh, Master Ricky Wong, Michell Koo and Ugene Woon flew to India to promote FusionExcel's excellent range of scalar energy products to the people of India.



With the warm reception that greeted us upon our arrival in India, we wasted no time in making arrangements to meet the key people there. We were joined by very close friends, Mr Pattabhi and Mr Bharat who arranged the daily meetings. Everyday large group of prospects came over to find out more about our products. Many of them were suitably impressed with the demos and immediately bought at least one set for themselves and their families.



On our trip to Hyderabad, we had the rare opportunity to meet the Indian National Track and Field Coach N Ramesh and we watch Indian Olympic athletes doing their training. Being sportsmen, injuries are part and parcel of their daily life. So it was a good opportunity to showcase to them the effectiveness of FE's Quantum Science products. The athletes who tried out our Quantum Pendants reported relieve to their back injuries almost instantaneously while another athlete, who had a sprained ankle informed us that she could stretch and bend her legs a short while later! This led to the coach and another national veteran runner trying the QP for themselves and they were very much pleased with the results! They even enquired when we will be returning to India again!



We believe that India has a very huge potential to be transformed into another major market and our initial trip focused on laying the ground work for future development. We envisioned that with the establishment of FusionExcel in India, it would be the best springboard for reaching out to the many people there who really need our products.</description><keyword>FE Expands Into India!</keyword><robots>all</robots><author>klhunter</author></meta></en><bm><title>FE Expands Into India!</title><content></content><meta><description>REPORT BY FE PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTOR AMY TEH.
