			<description>FE met and presented the Quantum Pendant to Ex-Governor of Bulacan province, Philippines, Josefina Mendoza-Dela Cruz, who is now the Special Advisor to the current governor of Bulacan province (her brother).



Ex-Governor Josefina was very impressed with the demonstrations and benefits of FE's Quantum Pendant, and is keen to explore the marketing of FE's Quantum Pendant in the Philippines and overseas through the vast overseas Filipino workers (OFW) network. There are 9 million OFWs around the world, with almost a million in California alone. The potential for FE's Quantum Pendant globally is huge!
