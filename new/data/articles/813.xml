&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp; I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed when the test of balance, flexibility and strength was administered to me. But all that faded instantly when I experienced for the very first time the improvement I&amp;rsquo;ve had with scalar energy that comes through the FusionExcel Quantum Pendant. If this is what it can do to me beneficially, how much more to the team I was coaching.&amp;nbsp;Experiencing the demo, my team remained skeptical. However, when we used the FusionExcel Sports Flask in one of our games, and we won that game, my team was convinced and immediately wanted to have FusionExcel&amp;rsquo;s scalar energy products. Aside from coaching, I also play badminton. Without the Quantum Pendant, I could only play four straight sets. Now with the Quantum Pendant I can play eight straight sets! My badminton playmates saw the difference and could not believe it. My PBA team, the Ginebra Kings now benefits from scalar energy together with my badminton playmates as well. I highly recommend FusionExcel&amp;rsquo;s scalar energy products to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
