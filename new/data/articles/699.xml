								&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHALIN ZULKIFLI CREDENTIALS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
								&lt;br /&gt;
								- Credentials Include Malaysian National Bowling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
								&amp;nbsp; Team Member For The Past 14 years.&lt;br /&gt;
								- 5 times Malaysian National Sportswoman Award Winner.&lt;br /&gt;
								- International Bowling Hall of Fame Inductee.&lt;br /&gt;
								- World Bowling Champion.&lt;br /&gt;
								- 5 times National Champion.&lt;br /&gt;
								- Ranked 4th In The World In 2007.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
								&lt;br /&gt;
								As a full time national athlete and businesswoman, I live a very fast paced and hectic lifestyle. As an athlete, I train daily and I bowl an average of 20 tournaments overseas a year. When I&amp;rsquo;m not training or competing overseas, I run my Bowling Centre &amp;ldquo;Pin Junction&amp;rdquo; with my fianc&amp;eacute;e and family. At times I would work 16 hours a day on top of my daily training and gym workout sessions.&lt;br /&gt;
								&lt;br /&gt;
								I have constantly experienced muscle aches, fatigue and high stress situations in my work and when I&amp;rsquo;m competing. Since I was introduced to and started wearing FusionExcel&amp;rsquo;s Quantum Pendant, I have felt and experienced a fantastic increase in my ability to concentrate on my competitive and business commitments.&lt;br /&gt;
								&lt;br /&gt;
								Bowling is a sport that requires maintaining a high level of concentration for a long period (we compete for about 4 to 6 hours) of time, balance and stamina. After wearing the Quantum Pendant, I feel more energized, more alert and my stamina has improved tremendously. It has given me the winning edge over my opponents because I feel more calm, relaxed and confident when I compete and it has translated into an improvement in my performance. I even bowled a perfect game (300 games, 12 strikes in a row) with it after a week!&lt;br /&gt;
								&lt;br /&gt;
								I would strongly recommend the Quantum Pendant to everyone; if it has helped me, imagine what it can do for you!&lt;br /&gt;
								&lt;br /&gt;

Singapore hearing-impaired group's BEP at StarBucks, Plaza Singapura, Singapore, 31st July 2009.



The Singapore hearing-impaired FE leaders recently held their regular BEP (Business Entrepreneurs Presentation) at Starbucks, Plaza Singapura on 31st July 2009 and it was attended by more than 30 hearing-impaired people. 



FE Leader Jimmy Chan used sign language to present the benefits of FE's Quantum Pendant and the marketing plan to an enthusiastic crowd. He was assisted by FE leaders Della, Stephen Wan, Ai Ling and Nathan.



It was amazing as many shoppers stopped to look at our Quantum Pendant demonstrations and some asked questions and even left their calling cards for further follow up actions.



PD KC Phoon, through sign-language interpreter Evelyn, delivered a speech on FE's vision and mission in Singapore and also its global business opportunity.



Although they are hearing-impaired, they are very enthusiastic about FE's business opportunity and believe that FE, through its superior income plan, can help improve their lifestyle. Some are already earning a good income from the FE business.



It was indeed inspiring to see our hearing-impaired FE Leaders giving their best at these presentations. Well done!
