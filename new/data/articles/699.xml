Singapore hearing-impaired group's BEP at StarBucks, Plaza Singapura, Singapore, 31st July 2009.



The Singapore hearing-impaired FE leaders recently held their regular BEP (Business Entrepreneurs Presentation) at Starbucks, Plaza Singapura on 31st July 2009 and it was attended by more than 30 hearing-impaired people. 



FE Leader Jimmy Chan used sign language to present the benefits of FE's Quantum Pendant and the marketing plan to an enthusiastic crowd.&amp;nbsp;He was assisted by FE leaders Della, Stephen Wan, Ai Ling and Nathan.



It was amazing as many shoppers stopped to look at our Quantum Pendant demonstrations and some asked questions and even left their calling cards for further follow up actions.



PD KC Phoon, through sign-language interpreter Evelyn, delivered a speech on FE's vision and mission in Singapore and also its global business opportunity.



Although they are hearing-impaired, they are very enthusiastic about FE's business opportunity and believe that FE, through its superior income plan, can help improve their lifestyle.&amp;nbsp;Some are already earning a good income from the FE business.



It was indeed inspiring to see our hearing-impaired FE Leaders giving their best at these presentations. Well done!
