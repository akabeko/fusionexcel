								FE&amp;#39;s Founder CEO Paul Ting and PD KC Phoon recently attended Thai PD Jankij&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Khonmaithammada&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Mission Impossible&amp;quot; 2 Days 1 Night Training Programme at Wangthep Resort, Amp Wangmuang, Saraburi, Thailand on Sunday 26th July 2009. Saraburi is 3 hours drive from metro Bangkok. There were 250 participants, comprising of PDs, EDs, Directors and new Members, some driving all the way from Chiang Mai, 600 kms away! This shows the committment and determination of FE&amp;#39;s Thai leaders. The &amp;quot;Mission Impossible&amp;quot; Training at Saraburi is the 15th such training conducted by PD Jankij and his leaders and has produced over 34 PDs in Thailand. Paul and KC were suitably impressed and touched by the warm welcome and emotionally charged and powerful atmosphere. Tears flowed freely at some of the presentations and sharings. There were also excitement, fun and laughter as the members participated in the games.These are hungry members, hungry to succeed and very determined to break out of the poverty cycle that engulf them.They desperately want to be the 1st of their generation to achieve their dream of financial freedom, so that they can help their family and society. FE is their hope and opportunity to achieve that dream. So far hundreds of FE members in Thailand have achieved their dreams. Going by what we saw, we can see many many more joining their ranks soon!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
