				Last month, Presidential Director Rachel Thomas made inaugural visits to Ghana &amp;amp; Zambia. The first such visit by a senior FE member, her visit coincided with an international Christian Church conference in Accra, Ghana. The two day religious conference was followed by the first FE Business workshop lead by PD Rachel Thomas, from 8-10th March. Some 60 church members participated in the workshop, themed &amp;quot;Be Healthy, Be Wealthy &amp;amp; Be Wise&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Be Healthy&amp;quot;, attributed to the amazing and wonderful health and wellness benefits derived from FE&amp;#39;s Quantum Science products by the public worldwide and &amp;quot;Be Wealthy&amp;quot;, refers to the generous income plan enjoyed by FE members. &amp;quot;Be Wise&amp;quot; signified the time leveraging in network marketing and the freeing up of time to enjoy other pursuits in life. The workshop was well received by all the participants who found PD Rachel&amp;#39;s talk motivating and interesting. She also gave several local radio interviews. She was accompanied by FE member Rev Dr Thomas. Thereafter, PD Rachel Thomas visited Kumasi, the second biggest town in Ghana and conducted a BEP, followed by a day of training. On arrival she was greeted at Kumasi airport by ten prospective FE members and offered a warm welcome to Kumasi. Rev Brother Freddie and wife Julia have been appointed as FE Country Licensee for Ghana.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;

She also gave a radio interview. Her Lusaka BEP was filmed and shown on Zambian national TV! Thereafter, she travelled to copperbelt town of Kitwe for another BEP. Both BEPs were well received. Despite the hectic schedule, she managed a brief stopover at Livingston and spent an hour at the famous Victoria Falls and was blessed with the waterfall&amp;#39;s sprays &amp;amp; drenching. Rajen Ranchhod, a prominent businessman has been appointed Country Licensee for Ghana, DRC &amp;amp; Zimbabwe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
