				Around 10 Leaders from Laos together with their Thai up lines visited FusionExcel Country Licensee Don Chan&amp;#39;s office on Tuesday 01st September 2009. This was following from Don&amp;#39;s very successful BEP at the 5 Stars Don Chan Palace Hotel, Vientiane on 15th August where 700 people attended.
				&lt;p&gt;
					The Leaders met and had lunch with FusionExcel&amp;rsquo;s Founder CEO Paul Ting and Don Chan. They also met Thai Movie Superstar Dr Sombat Methanee, wife Kanchana Methanee, Jerome Vinarao (President of Philippines Center for Arts Foundation), it&amp;#39;s Director, jazz singer Stella Ignacio and 9 years old singing sensation Clark Gamul, all of whom performed some songs for them. The Laotian Leaders were indeed very lucky to have such talent performing privately for them! They are all very excited and motivated about FUSION EXCEL and are raring to go in Laos! AHOO! AHOO!! AHOO!!!&lt;/p&gt;

</content><meta><description>FE's Founder CEO Paul Ting appeared on Thailand's Nation Channel TTV1's program &amp;quot;Khondee Me Sa Ra &amp;quot;, &amp;quot; Good Stories From Good People &amp;quot; with TV host Don Chan (who is also FE's Thai Country Licensee) to talk about FE's social entrepreneurship program &amp;quot;Hope For Children&amp;quot;. Appearing on the program was Thai Movie Superstar Dr Sombat Methanee, with 700 movies to his credit, Jerome Vinarao, President of the Center For Arts Foundation, Philippines and 9 year year old Filipino singing sensation Clark Gamul who is a product of the Center For Arts Foundation. Clark performed 3 songs for the TV program. The Center For Arts Foundation, with many Filipino celebrities and artistes who contribute their time and effort to help train and groom talented children from poor families, has 11 centres throughout the Philippines and has trained over 75,000 Filipinos in the performing arts over it's 10 years history.

 

FE's &amp;quot;Hope For Children&amp;quot; Charity program will be collaborating with the Philippines Center For Arts Foundation and Thai Superstar Dr Sombat Methanee to set up a similar Foundation in Thailand to help train and groom Thai children from poor families in the performing arts. At the same time there will be exchanges of celebrities, artistes and talented children between Thailand and Philippines which will foster better relationships and goodwill between the two countries. 

 

FE hopes that with the financial support from FE's &amp;quot;Hope For Children&amp;quot; Charity Program similar Foundations can be set up in Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos in the immediate future and later throughout the world. FE believes that to change the world and to make it a better place we need to start with the children. Children are our future leaders and FE is proud that we are able to lend them a supporting hand !

 

The &amp;quot;Khondee Me Sa Ra&amp;quot; TV program similar in style to CNN's Larry King program, will be aired over 3 days on Sunday 6th September, Saturday 12th September and Sunday 13th September at 2.30 pm Thailand time.
