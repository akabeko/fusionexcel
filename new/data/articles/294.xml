													&lt;strong&gt;REPORT FROM KENNETH LEE, PHILIPPINES.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
													&lt;br /&gt;
													I have the privilege of sending herewith pictures of my wife and I presenting an array of FE&amp;#39;s Scalar Energy products of a Quantum Pendant, a Quantum Flask and a Quantum Bracelet to Philippine&amp;#39;s No.1 Sporting Hero, Manny Pacquiao.&lt;br /&gt;
													&lt;br /&gt;
													Manny is currently the WBC Lightweight Champion and the WBC Super Featherweight Champion. He is also World Champion at IBF Super Bantamweight&amp;nbsp; and WBC Flyweight divisions. He is the first Filipino and Asian boxer to win four World Titles in different weight divisions and is currently pound for pound, the No.1 ranked Boxer in the World!&lt;br /&gt;
													&lt;br /&gt;
													So it was with a deep sense of awe and respect for the pugilistic achievements of this World Class personality that we presented him with our gifts, and in doing so, giving him a brief explanation of the benefits of FE&amp;#39;s Scalar Energy products. No presentation would be complete without a demo, and as sure as the sun rises, even the great man&amp;nbsp;himself&amp;nbsp;was amazed at the instant physical results he experienced!&lt;br /&gt;
													&lt;br /&gt;
													The following&amp;nbsp;pictures were taken in the gorgeous mansion of Manny Pacquiao, on the last day of what was a very hectic schedule during our promotional tour of the southern Philippines island of Mindanao, in particular the General Santos City 10th Tuna Festival, of which FE was a Corporate Sponsor. Manny is the proud hometown boy of GenSan.&lt;br /&gt;
													&lt;br /&gt;
													Manny Pacquiao has just inked a lucrative new fight deal to square off with the legendary Oscar De La Hoya. This fight of the year takes place on December 6th at MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada and has been hailed by Manny Pacquiao himself as being his greatest challenge.&lt;br /&gt;
													&lt;br /&gt;
													FE wishes Manny Pacquiao nothing but the very best of success that he so richly deserves!&lt;/div&gt;

I have the privilege of sending herewith pictures of my wife and I presenting an array of FE's Scalar Energy products of a Quantum Pendant, a Quantum Flask and a Quantum Bracelet to Philippine's No.1 Sporting Hero, Manny Pacquiao.

Manny is currently the WBC Lightweight Champion and the WBC Super Featherweight Champion. He is also World Champion at IBF Super Bantamweight  and WBC Flyweight divisions. He is the first Filipino and Asian boxer to win four World Titles in different weight divisions and is currently pound-for-pound, the No.1 ranked boxer in the World!

So it was with a deep sense of awe and respect for the pugilistic achievements of this World-Class personality that we presented him with our gifts, and in doing so, giving him a brief explanation of the benefits of FE's Scalar Energy products. No presentation would be complete without a demo, and as sure as the sun rises, even the great man himself was amazed at the instant physical results he experienced!

The following pictures were taken in the gorgeous mansion of Manny Pacquiao, on the last day of what was a very hectic schedule during our promotional tour of the southern Philippines island of Mindanao, in particular the General Santos City 10th Tuna Festival, of which FE was a Corporate Sponsor. Manny is the proud hometown boy of GenSan.

Manny Pacquiao has just inked a lucrative new fight deal to square off with the legendary Oscar De La Hoya. This fight-of-the-year takes place on December 6th at MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada and has been hailed by Manny himself as being his greatest challenge.
