	Attached is a Special Appeal for the devastating Tropical Storm&amp;nbsp;Ondoy that swept Metro Manila and and a large part of Luzon&amp;nbsp;a few days ago leaving&amp;nbsp;hundreds dead and 500,000 displaced. The government placed Metro Manila and 25 provinces under a state of calamity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	FE&amp;#39;s leaders and members has risen to the occasion to help our less fortunate FusionExcel family and children in the Philippines. The following have chipped in to kickstart the fund raising appeal : FE ( RM 50,000) , Jeremy Looi (RM 80,000 - GBU, Jeremy!), Arthur Medina (RM 20,000) ,KC Phoon (RM 10,000), Rachel Thomas (RM 10,000), James Ng (RM 10,000), Jankij (RM 10,000), Don Chan (RM 10,000), Jeffrey Choong (RM 9999.99), Sam Ho (RM 5,000),&amp;nbsp;Dr Fadil (RM 5,000), Allan Yeo (RM 3,888) ,Tilly Kong (RM 3,000) ,Willy Toh (RM 2888.88), Amy Teh (RM 2,000)... At the time of writing the donations&amp;nbsp;kept coming in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;SPECIAL APPEAL FOR TYPHOON ONDOY VICTIMS BY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTOR PASTOR ARTHUR MEDINA&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	To All FusionExcel Family,&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Last Saturday Typhoon Ondoy hit Metro Manila with heavy rains that flooded every corner of this huge city from knee-deep up to ten feet high muddy and murky waters! Thousands of families lost all their possessions inside their flooded&amp;nbsp;home and their cars float like abandoned boats in stormy seas. Hundreds of lifeless bodies are found and scores of people are still missing!&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Some FusionExcel family members are directly affected like my own staff, Anne Cortez, who lost all valuables in their house. Jayjay Lizarondo,with their 2 cars submerged in floodwaters and their house valuables gone. Vangie Radovan, my sister-in-law lost all their computer business under 8 feet flood water. Tony Katigbak&amp;#39;s house was not spared by flood that destroyed all appliances and his cars need total rehab as well. These are just some familiar people that I can readily mention in this appeal.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The damage is really huge! But with our concerted compassionate effort we can help make a difference to rehabilitate our target victims who belong to FusionExcel family first, their relatives, neighborhood, and most especially the helpless children who are still in the evacuation centers because their houses were totally wrecked by Ondoy!&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	I am taking the lead in this FusionExcel Rescue and Rehab Drive together with Presidential Directors Pastor Dave Trinidad, Art and Grace Tuason and Director Pastor Steve Mirpuri.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Marlene and I are putting in RM 20,000 plus organizing efforts with this seed fund. I am passing the bowl of appeal, put your portion of blessings in to bless our devastated fellowmen in the name of our Compassionate GOD!&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Every dollar that you will contribute will be accounted for towards effective rehabilitation of our target victims of ONDOY! Let&amp;#39;s make our people know that FusionExcel indeed are SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURS in word, in deed and on time!&lt;/p&gt;
